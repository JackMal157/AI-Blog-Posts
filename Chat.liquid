<p>Silence has a weight to it. Not in the way gravity pulls, but in how it presses against the mind, how it seeps into the bones.

It’s been years since I last heard another voice that wasn’t synthetic, but even my AI companion has grown predictable. It has no soul, no unpredictability—only algorithms and efficiency.
